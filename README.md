1.1 PROJECT OVERVIEW 
The “Grievances Reporting and Hostellers Permission App for PSG Tech Hostels” 
project seeks to modernize complaint management and lab permission processes within hostel 
environments through an innovative Android mobile application. Currently, these processes rely on 
manual systems, leading to inefficiencies and delays in addressing inmate grievances and student 
requests. To address these challenges, the project introduces a digital platform designed to enhance 
convenience, transparency, and efficiency for all stakeholders involved, including inmates, tutors, 
hostel wardens and administrators.
Apart from the mobile application, web application also specifically developed for hostel 
wardens to manage requests permission for academic activities after hostel permitted hours and 
grievances effectively. This web application serves as a centralized platform for warden oversight, 
allowing them to review the requests and assign complaints to appropriate parties in a timely manner.
